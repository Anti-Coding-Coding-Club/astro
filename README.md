**🌎 README is available in other languages:  [🇧🇷](translations/README_pt-br.md)**

Astro is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), and based on everything we love about our favourite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.

### 🚀 Why Astro?

Astro is a Free Libre Software, that said, you will never expect us to simply sunset the project. Instead, if we consider giving it up, we will let the community handle it, allowing users to still enjoy its features.
